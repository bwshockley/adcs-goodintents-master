This application provides users a list of local charities and events for which they may "check-in" at.

## Synopsis

This is source code for an Android application written during the 2015 Android Developers Career Summit at Google.  The intent of this app is to provide "social good" while engaging the users to share in social good.
The team used knowledge learned through our Android nanodegree program with Udacity and Google to create this app.

## Code Usage

This app utilized many Android app design philosophies and classes such as Notification Services, Google login via Google Play Services 8.3, Page Viewers, FloatingActionButtons, Profiles, Android Maps API, ReceyclerViews, ContentProviders, Camera API, and Deep Linking.

## Motivation

Our team, Good Intents, wanted to create a social good app for the Android Career Developers Summit that motivated individuals to volunteer and encourage their friends to volunteer also.  To that end, we created this social "Check In" application that lists the local events, a list of events your friends are partaking in, and events you are registered for or past events.

## Installation

Download this app, import into Android Studio and then install onto your Android device.

## API Reference

This application used the [Volunteer Match public API](https://www.volunteermatch.org/legal/publicuseapi) in order to retreive nearby volunteer events.  Due to the timing available for this project, the full API was not implemented, but the data was stored locally instead.
